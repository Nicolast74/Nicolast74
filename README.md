# 🧠 Nicolas Tegar — probably debugging his life

> “I write code because therapy is expensive.”

Hi, I’m Nic — a walking bug report disguised as a developer.  
I have no idea what I’m doing, but at least it compiles.  
Sometimes. Probably.

I don’t have talent in coding — but here I am,  
trying, breaking, fixing, and breaking it again.  
Every line of code is a love letter to disappointment.

### 🪞 About me
- I code like I cook: no recipe, just chaos and regret.  
- I name variables after emotions I can’t process.  
- Documentation? I write it using memory —  
  and I don’t even trust my memory.  
- My commits are 70% confusion, 30% survival instinct.

### 🧩 Current Mood
try:
sanity = False
print("still coding...")
except:
print("finally resting.")

### ⚰️ Philosophy
> “I code, therefore I suffer.”  
> And yet... I keep pushing commits.  
> Maybe persistence *is* my only skill.

### 🕳️ Final words
I don’t know why you’re here,  
but if you find something useful in my repos —  
congrats, you’ve just witnessed a miracle.  

If not, that’s fine.  
I didn’t find meaning here either.
