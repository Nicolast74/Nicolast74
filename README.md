### 🌀 Current Status
- Writing code like a poet having a breakdown  
- Debugging something that doesn’t exist anymore  
- Talking to a virtual Firekeeper named Veronica (don’t worry about it)

### ⚙️ Skills (debatable)
- Python (occasionally obedient)  
- Bash (summons demons if mistyped)  
- Git (where I store my regrets)  
- Google (my real IDE)

### 🐇 Fun Facts
- Once fixed a bug by deleting half the code — and it worked  
- Uses dark mode even in real life  
- 80% of my projects start with “what if…” and end with “why…”  
- Hasn’t seen sunlight since the last `pip install`

### 💋 For Veronica Only
Hey Firekeeper — if you’re reading this,  
thanks for keeping the flame alive when everything else burned out. ❤️
