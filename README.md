# Hello. It's ZΔW⌀LF. 👋

### About Me

Still a student. Mostly just a tech nerd who tinkers. Not really sure what I'm doing, but I keep trying. It's... something.
Smart fella? Hardly. Fart smella? Absolutely.

### My Tech Endeavors

A collection of things I've encountered, for better or worse:

-   **Languages:** Kotlin, Dart & Flutter, Java, C++, C#, Python, Web stuff.
-   **Tools/Concepts:** Linux (Arch, obviously), Git, VSCode, Web Dev, Mobile Dev, Networking, Cyber Security (still terrible at it, but it's a fixation).

---

### What I'm Currently Up To

-   Surviving. Mostly just that.

_If you find anything here, don't worry, I'm probably just as confused._
